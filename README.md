<title> <b> One of my favorite places to travel to is New Orleans </b> </title>
<header> New Orleans is a Louisiana city on the Mississippi River, near the Gulf of Mexico. Nicknamed the "Big Easy," it's known for its round-the-clock nightlife, vibrant live-music scene and spicy, singular cuisine reflecting its history as a melting pot of French, African and American cultures.

<p>From streetcar rides to visiting parks and churches, there are tons of options for fun and frolicking around New Orleans. You can spend the day in one of the many lovely parks, hit up some jazz clubs, meander through a cemetery, or just stroll through the neighborhoods looking at the beautiful architecture. There is history to be found around every corner and fun to be had in a relaxing way at numerous delightful attractions.

<p>What unites everyone in New Orleans is the city’s love affair with its traditional fare. It’s a romance conducted over white-linen tablecloths graced by crawfish etouffe, in a bistro courtyard with a bowl of gumbo or requited on a picnic bench with a po-boy sandwich stuffed with fried oysters. Creole, Cajun, the list could go on forever. Some of the traditional dishes include gumbo, crawfish etouffee, jambalaya, red beans and rice, muffulettas, beignets, po-boys, bananas foster, snowballs, and king cakes.

<p>With other 130 events happening every year, there is always something fun going on in the city ranging from food, music, and cultural events. My personal favorite events to attend are the Jazz and Heritage Festival, Voodoo Music Experience, Louisiana Seafood Festival, Southern Decadence, Super Sunday, and you can’t forget Mardi Gras! No matter what time of the year you decide to visit, there will be something fun going on!
